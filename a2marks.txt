CS 349 Assign 2 Marking Scheme
Marker: Valerie

100 marks possible for this assignment
No single section can receive fewer than zero marks (e.g. no makefile and it doesn’t build, but we can get it building, will result in 0 marks for Infrastructure).

Infrastructure (5 marks)
[3/3] Includes makefile or Eclipse project
[2/2] README file included
    [-5] Doesn’t compile (e.g. package name missing from source file)

Basic requirements (80 marks)
[10/10] The crane consists of body, tracks, four arm segments and an electromagnet.
    [-5] Penalize every arm segment fewer than four (e.g. 3 segments is 10-5=5 net marks).
[3/5] The crane can be moved left and right via direct manipulation with the mouse.
    **[-2] The crane can be moved completely off-screen in either direction.
[15/20] The arm segments are articulated and can be moved via direct manipulation. Arms can rotate 360 degrees, and we don’t need to handle collision between arm segments (i.e. they can overlap). However, some minor rotation or movement constraints should be in place to prevent arm segments from falling through the ground.
    **[-5] Segments can rotate through the ground.
[20/20] When placed directly over a block, the magnet can be used to pick up that block. The magnet must be parallel (or near-parallel) to the top of the block to pick it up. The magnet can be turned on or off by direct manipulation (i.e. clicking on the electromagnetic attachment). Once attached, the block should move with the magnet.
[25/25] Blocks can be stacked on the ground, or on one another. Blocks that are detached without being parallel to the receiving surface should not be allowed (specific results are left to the user - they can shatter, or return to their starting position). Collision detection should be implemented such that blocks cannot be placed inside of other blocks (i.e. they should stack). There should be some small allowance for blocks being dropped a few pixels above the surface (i.e. it will be difficult to line up pixel-for-pixel, so dropping within a small number of pixels should be allowed)
    [-15] No collision detection with blocks, so that they can only be stacked on the ground.

Non-requirements
- The crane arm and magnet can move in front of the blocks (assume traveling in the front plane). Selective collision detection (e.g. crane body moves in front, but magnet is blocked) is a possible enhancement.
- Once the magnet picks up a block, it can move that block in front of other blocks. You only need to check for collisions when the block is placed.

[10/15] Enhancements
** some physics/animation
** a pleasure to use, with wide tolerances for picking up/dropping
